Privacy Policy for SysOps Flash Card on the Google Assistant

The content for SysOps Flash Card has been developed by CloudFusion. However, SysOps Flash Card runs on systems provided by Google, and CloudFusion does not have full access to the app. In particular, CloudFusion has no ability to access the messages you send to SysOps Flash Card or the responses that it sends back to you.

CloudFusion may receive from Google non-personally identifying information about the use of SysOps Flash Card. For instance, CloudFusion can access usage information regarding how many users are using the app, which geographical regions they are located in, and basic data including users’ language, device type, and length and frequency of use. None of the information CloudFusion receives from Google identifies you, nor does it reveal to CloudFusion what information you sent to the app or what specific responses the app sent to you.

When you use SysOps Flash Card, you are also using the Google Assistant, and the Google Privacy Policy describes how Google collects and uses data about your use of the app. You may wish to consult Google’s documentation regarding what information is shared with your Google Assistant and how to delete your Google Assistant activity.

CloudFusion may, in the future, modify SysOps Flash Card to run on infrastructure which CloudFusion has full access to, which would allow CloudFusion access to additional information about your interaction with the app. Should that occur, CloudFusion will comply with its obligations under applicable privacy law, including updating this Privacy Policy as required.
